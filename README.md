ElasticMap is an ODM for Elasticsearch and query DSL in a OO style.

## Why ElasticMap?

TODO: Write why ElasticMap here

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'elastic_map'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install elastic_map

## Usage

### Client settings

There are two ways to configure the ElasticMap client: the `ElasticMap.settings` hash and `elastic_map.yml`

```ruby
# config/initializers/elastic_map.rb
ElasticMap.settings = {host: 'localhost:9250'} # do not use environments
```

```yaml
# config/elastic_map.yml
# separate environment configs
test:
  host: 'localhost:9250'
  prefix: 'test'
development:
  host: 'localhost:9200'
```

The logger may be set explicitly:

```ruby
ElasticMap.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
```
See [config.rb](lib/elastic_map/config.rb) for more details.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
